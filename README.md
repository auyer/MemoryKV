# MemoryKV

I like to learn thing by doing them.
This is a in memory Key Value store in Rust. It also has a Write Ahead Log served with Websockets.

# About this project

What I wanted to create:

- In memory database (like Redis)
- Using cuncurrent patterns (unlike Redis)
- In the Rust programming language
- With a live feed of changes (it felt like a cool demo for my personal site)

I started implementing an http web server using Axum. I did this because I am used to working with http and rest interfaces. I might implement my own connection method, but this will be fine for now.
Since I was using Axum I also added a `/metrics` endpoint for Prometheus.

The "database" part I created with a simple HashMap, and protected it behind a RWMutex.

The "WAL/live feed" part was implemented internally using a Broadcast channel. The http part exposes this as a websocket.

All of this is shared between threads (or tokio tasks) with Arc (Atomic Atomically Reference Counted pointers).

A sample of the WAL received by a WebSocket client:

```prolog has the right colors
23:42 23.17 Heartbeat from 127.0.0.1:36460
23:42 14.02 Read { key: pre:fix:for_key_value:perfect}
23:42 03.70 List
23:42 03.17 Heartbeat from 127.0.0.1:53374
23:41 29.96 Read { key: pre:demo:key}
23:41 23.17 Heartbeat from 127.0.0.1:36460
23:41 17.34 ListPrefix { prefix: pre}
23:41 05.19 Insert { key: pre:demo:key, value: {"source": "CloudFlare Worker", "type": "WASM"} }
23:41 03.19 Heartbeat from 127.0.0.1:53374
23:41 03.18 Connected to ws://localhost:8080/wal
23:41 03.17 Connecting to ws://localhost:8080/wal
```

The live demo is available in my personal website: https://rcpassos.me/projects/kv
